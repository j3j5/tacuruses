# Tacuruses üêú

Tacuruses is an ActivityPub server built using PHP and Laravel. It started out as a personal project to learn how ActivityPub works and it ended up powering all my bots posting to the fediverse. It isn't feature complete yet but it already federates properly and allows its messages to be seen from any server speaking ActivityPub.

# Name

"_Tacur√∫_" is the name given to the anthill made by [some ants](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camponotus_punctulatus) living in South America (Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia...). [Their anthills](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vista_general_de_tacuruses_en_un_campo_1.jpg) are like [little mountains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tacuruses_de_cerca_01.jpg) that can grow up to a meter. In a way, the fediverse reminds me a lot of the fields where this ants live. _Tacuruses_ is the plural form of "_tacur√∫_". "_Tacur√∫_" is also the name the ants receive, in some parts they are also called "_cup√≠_".
